=============
Graphs are a common type of data encountered by analysts. Social networks, co-author networks, and gene interactions can all be represented as graphs. These types of data can be difficult to understand without the aid of a visualization. Visual analytics tools with graph visualizations allows the analysts to view data as a node link diagram. Vertices or nodes represent objects. Edges represent the relationship between two nodes. To render graphs, a number of automatic graph layouts have been developed. These algorithms use properties of the graph, like the number of interconnections between nodes, to compute positions for the graphâ€™s vertices. While these algorithms have a number of parameters that can be adjusted to affect the layout, they are automatic - no analyst input is used to position the graph nodes.
